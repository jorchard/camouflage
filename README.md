# camouflage

The notebook `gan.ipynb` uses MNIST, and assumes it is in the `files/` folder. With a working CNN, working FNN, and a CNN with some error, which haven't found yet.

The notebook `DCGAN.ipynb` contains some useful methods like generating statistic analysis and save animation while training. Modified from [tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/dcgan_faces_tutorial.html). It uses MNIST, and assumes it is in the `files/` folder.

The notebook `camoulage.ipynb` tries to reproduce the result of [camouflage paper](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/2041-210X.13334) using pytorch, and [here](https://gitlab.com/asb-lab/camogan) is the code written in tensorflow.
