# camouflage

Originally, they wrote [camouflage paper](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/2041-210X.13334) using tensorflow1.4, and [here](https://gitlab.com/asb-lab/camogan) is the code.

We now have `camoGAN.ipynb` written in pytorch.

A pretrained model (device must be cuda for this model) for 300 epochs has been provided [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kWLym52VTGsuiIvavmkJJkDN0MtEu_eK/view?usp=sharing)
